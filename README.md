About
-----

As a project for a Computer Engineering Course at Iowa State University, 
we will be using the accelerometer built into the iPhone/iPod Touch to 
read in and record a user specified motion. Then we will have the user 
do that same motion, and if it is a match, we will let them continue into the program.
